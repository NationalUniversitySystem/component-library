# Dev Component Library

This library holds code examples of components on the websites managed by the National University web dev team. There is a complementary Design Component Library managed in Figma by the Creative team, which holds the same components in a format easy to pull into mockups.

The first site to be built out is [www.nu.edu](https://nationaluniversitysystem.github.io/component-library/libraries/#/). Hopefully, the other sites will be added over time.
